# Online Library Management System

A local library is in dire need of a web application to ease their work. The library management system must allow a librarian to track books and their quantity, books issued to members, book fees. (It is of assumption that the app will be used by the librarian only.)

The following functionalities are expected from the application:
Base Library System
Librarians must be able to maintain:
- Books with stock maintained
- Members
- Transactions - [ Borrowing, Returns, Member registration, Member dismissal]
  
The use cases included here are to:
- Perform general CRUD operations on Books and Members
-	Issue a book to a member
- Issue a book return from a member
- Search for a book by name and author
- Charge a rent fee on book returns
